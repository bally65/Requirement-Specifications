# Requirement Specifications Hub

This repository serves as the central "Technical Truth" for all projects managed by the Singularity and Archimedes teams. It provides standardized templates, technical documentation standards, and requirement tracking.

## 📁 Repository Structure

-   **/templates**: Standardized templates for PRDs (Product Requirement Documents), SRS (Software Requirement Specifications), and System Designs.
-   **/projects**: Specific requirement documents organized by project name (e.g., `singularity-v3`, `archimedes-whole-body`).
-   **/standards**: Coding guidelines, API design standards, and security protocols.
-   **/automation**: Scripts for generating documentation from code or syncing requirements with tracking tools.

## 🛠️ Current Goals

1.  **Standardization**: Ensure all future projects follow the same architectural and documentation logic.
2.  **Traceability**: Map high-level business goals to specific technical implementation details.
3.  **Automation**: Auto-generate status reports for the Singularity trading engine and Archimedes training logs.

## 📄 Templates Available

-   `PRD_Template.md`: For high-level project vision and feature sets.
-   `SRS_Template.md`: For detailed technical constraints and functional requirements.
-   `API_Spec_Template.md`: For standardized endpoint and data structure documentation.
