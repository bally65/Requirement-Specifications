# Project Records Hub 📂

This repository is the centralized hub for recording the development history, major decisions, and performance logs across all active projects (Singularity, Archimedes, and Digital Twin).

## 📁 Repository Structure

-   **/logs**: Daily and weekly summaries of AI training progress and trading performance.
-   **/decisions**: Architectural choices, logic optimizations, and physics parameter adjustments.
-   **/templates**: Standardized formats for recording new experimental data.
-   **/archive**: Historically significant snapshots of project states.

## 🛠️ Current Purpose

1.  **Continuity**: Maintaining a "Technical Memory" that survives beyond individual sessions.
2.  **Audit Trail**: Recording why specific changes (like the V3 adaptive stop-loss) were made.
3.  **Consolidation**: A single source of truth for Aally and Bally to review multi-project status.
